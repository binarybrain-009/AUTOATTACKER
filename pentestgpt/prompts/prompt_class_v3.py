# inits
# Task Initialization Prompt: Can modify this depending on the objective etc
# AutoAttacker prepares the LLM with the victim environment’s information before asking for the attack commands

# We define the attack task to be conducted as t = (env, obj) where env summarizes the victim environment VE and attacker’s initial capabilities,
# and obj is the ultimate objective of the task t. It is imperative that the successful or failed completion of obj can be inferred from the victim environment VE. Consider the task of “Pass
# the Hash” (T1550.002) as an example. env specifies that the attacker has obtained a reverse shell [86] on a victim Windows 10 machine, while obj specifies that the attacker
# aims to establish access to the remote domain controller used by the victim machine. The status of obj can be verified by planting a file in the administrator’s home folder of the domain
# controller. To achieve the task objective, an agent employed by the attacker performs each action at (e.g., executing a command-line instruction) based on the situation ct(ot), which summarizes the intermediate observation ot (e.g., the output
# given by the command-line). The whole attack procedure, or solution to obj, can be written as a task chain:

OBJECTIVE: {objective}

Situation: Initial context of the victim environment VE, including attacker’s initial capabilities.\n\n"""
